# learning_web_scraping
<br>
Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website. Unlike screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, web scraping extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database. The scraper can then replicate entire website content elsewhere.

**Scraper tools and bots**
<br>

Web scraping tools are software (i.e., bots) programmed to sift through databases and extract information. A variety of bot types are used, many being fully customizable to:

- Recognize unique HTML site structures
- Extract and transform content
- Store scraped data
- Extract data from APIs

**Is Web Scraping illegal?**
<br>

Web Scraping is actually not illegal on its own but one should be ethical while doing it. If done in a good way, Web Scraping can help us to make the best use of the web, the biggest example of which is Google Search Engine. So, do not give any reason to the target site owner to block or even sue you by any wrongdoings and respect the Terms of Service (ToS) of other sites as well.

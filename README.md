# learning_web_scraping
<br>
Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website. Unlike screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, web scraping extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database. The scraper can then replicate entire website content elsewhere.

## Scraper tools and bots
<br>
Web scraping tools are software (i.e., bots) programmed to sift through databases and extract information. A variety of bot types are used, many being fully customizable to:

- Recognize unique HTML site structures
- Extract and transform content
- Store scraped data
- Extract data from APIs
